We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy exploring and building with it.

## Getting Started

- Get your Anthropic API key from: [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard)
- Get your Daytona API key from: [Daytona Dashboard](https://www.daytona.io/)

Add these keys to your `.env` file as follows:

``` .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=votre_cl√©_anthropic_ici

```

## Install & Run

```bash
cd lovable-ui

npm install
npm run dev
```

This will launch the app locally (by default at http://localhost:3000).
